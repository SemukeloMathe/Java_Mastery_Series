## What Is JAVA?

Java is a programming language that has multiple features that allows it to be used in the enterprise market. Most big companies use Java as their preferred language. In Java we have a technology called JVM (Java Virtual Machine). We have multiple languages running on JVM aswell. Java can be used for Development and Testing. It is also one of the most readable language. What this means is that you can read someone else code line by line and understand what is going on. It is also highly maintanable.
Java was made in 1995 by Sun Microsystems and was led by the team of James Gosling. and later on Oracle bought them.
